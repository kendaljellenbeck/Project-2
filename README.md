# Project-2
This is the first draft of Project 2 
You will need two files in order to adequately run the code. 
1. The Jupyter Notebook
2. The Dataset that was used (uploaded here) 


The dataset I used was only available in R language, so I had to download R studio and convert each of the datasets to python. Here is the github page where all the data is located: https://github.com/nhanhocu/metamicrobiome_breastfeeding . Once I was able to convert each of the datasets that I needed into csv files I was able to download them into my jupyter notebook and use the data for further analysis.
